# The E3SM Data Ocean Model

The E3SM data ocean has several different modes to support various realistic and idealized experiments. Sea surface temperatures (SST) can be either prescribed or prognostic. Prescribed SSTs are specified either through a data stream or analytically. Prognostic modes allow the SST field to evolve and respond to atmospheric conditions. The guides below provide more details on how to use these capabilities.
